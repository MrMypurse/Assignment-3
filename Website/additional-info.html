      <h2>Global Internet User Stats</h2>
      <p id="additional-info">
        According to the estimates of Freedom House, here are some important
        statistics regarding the 3.7 billion people with internet access:
        <br>
        <span class="percentage">71%</span> live in countries where information and communications technology
        users were arrested or imprisoned for posting political, social, or religious content.<br>
        <span class="percentage">55%</span> live in countries with blocked political, social, or religious content.<br>
        <span class="percentage">48%</span> live in countries where there have been attacks or murders related to online activities.<br>
        <span class="percentage">47%</span> live in countries where the authorities have increased their surveillance regarding user rights to privacy.<br>
        <span class="percentage">47%</span> live in countries where social media or messaging platforms have been blocked temporarily or permanently.<br>
        <span class="percentage">42%</span> live in countries where the government (often for political reasons) has disconnected internet or mobile networks.
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Largest Five-Year Declines</h2>
        Of the 65 countries in question, the following five underwent the most significant
        decrease in internet freedom within a five year time span (2014-2018):<br><br>
        <span class="percentage">Cambodia</span>: Amendments made in 2015 and 2018 to the Telecommunications Law and penal code resulted in an increase in arrests for political commentary on social media and news platforms.<br><br>
        <span class="percentage">Venezuela</span>: Internet access was reduced for citizens in relation to the country's economic crisis. Critical media sites are blocked, and political commentary is penalized.<br><br>
        <span class="percentage">Ukraine</span>: Related to the conflict with separatists (Russian-backed) and the Kremlin information war.<br><br>
        <span class="percentage">Egypt</span>: Digital activism often results in jail-time, and lengthy prison terms are sentenced for minor offenses. They also experienced a dramatic escalation in censorship from 2015 to 2018.<br><br>
        <span class="percentage">Turkey</span>: Thousands of citizens arrested for criticizing the government. Social media companies are censoring even non-violent political commentary as a cost of doing business in Turkey.<br><br><br>
