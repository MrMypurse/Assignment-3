      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>
        With the rising of social media platforms and technology companies, the world has entered the digital age. All though the internet has helped connecting people around the globe better than ever, democratic societies struggle to adjust under
        the pressure of digital authorianism and privacy invasion. Through content manipulation and media restrictions, the authorities are able to block any foreign social media and communication services. Many countries’ governments, such as China
        and Russia, are using Internet censorship and user surveillance to control their citizens. As a result of these dangerous trends, the internet freedom has declined for the eighth consecutive year in 2018. The health of the world’s democracies
        is under great risk.<br><br>
        Our website, The Globalization of Internet Access, is designed to raise awareness of Internet access limitation and help users to visualize how the internet is not as free as we think around the globe. The website focuses on the visual
        representation of Internet access statistics in different regions on a world map.The user can navigate through the website and interact with the regions using the mouse. Once a region is clicked on, a pop up window will show interesting
        Internet facts about this specific area.<br><br><br>
